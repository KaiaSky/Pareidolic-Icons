Pareidolic-Icons
================

A test of procedurally generating shapes that look like a face or body to create facial recognition, as a POC for Limit Theory.

Run icon.py to generate 8 images.
You'll need Pillow to run, this has been tested in 3.3 and only 3.3 as of right now. As I said, /very/ early

I am not associated with Limit Theory development in any form greater than as a poster upon the form, and there is no guarentee this will ever be added to LT at all. Ever.
